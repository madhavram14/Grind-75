The problem is to to go through an array and find 2 numbers such that the sum of them is equal to target. So we find the 2 numbers given the array(nums) and the target(sum should add upto). Was a little difficult at start since the inside loop need not compare the number at an index with itself but eventually could find it out.  Used normal method to solve this problem. Seems like the complexity was N^2, after reading a little found out there is an easier way to solve it using dictionaries(hash map).
